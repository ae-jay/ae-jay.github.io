                    <h3>Conservation Biology</h3>
                    <p>Focuses on protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from extinction and degradation. This involves understanding ecological processes, human impacts, and developing strategies for sustainable coexistence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-card" data-research-id="area2">
                    <h3>Behavioral Ecology</h3>
                    <p>Explores how animal behavior is shaped by ecological and evolutionary pressures. Research in this area often examines foraging strategies, mating systems, social interactions, and predator-prey dynamics.</p>

                    <h3>Climate Change Ecology</h3>
                    <p>Investigates the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, species distributions, phenology, and community structures. This includes studying adaptation, vulnerability, and potential mitigation strategies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-card" data-research-id="area4">
                    <h3>Urban Ecology</h3>
                    <p>Studies the interactions between humans and natural systems in urban environments. This interdisciplinary field examines biodiversity in cities, urban planning for sustainability, and the ecological roles of urban green spaces.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="research-card" data-research-id="area5">
                    <h3>Restoration Ecology</h3>
                    <p>Dedicated to assisting the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It involves applying ecological principles to restore biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and resilience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-card" data-research-id="area6">
                    <h3>Wildlife Disease Ecology</h3>
                    <p>Examines the dynamics of diseases in wild animal populations, including their causes, transmission, and impacts on host populations and ecosystem health. This often involves epidemiology, immunology, and conservation aspects.</p>
