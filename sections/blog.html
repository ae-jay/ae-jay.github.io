                                <p>The absence of a significant effect of artificial light at night (ALAN) on the common tailorbird's dawn chorus onset, while contrasting with many temperate studies that show advancements (Kempenaers et al. 2010; Da Silva et al. 2015; Nordt & Klenke 2013), aligns with several other previous investigations in tropical regions that also found no such association (Dorado-Correa et al. 2016; Stuart et al. 2019). This supports the hypothesis that tropical species, experiencing minimal seasonal photoperiodic variation, may be less sensitive to light as a critical cue for timing reproductive behaviours such as dawn song (Dorado-Correa et al. 2016). Similarly, the lack of significant influence from temperature, humidity, and moon illumination on dawn chorus timing, despite some studies reporting effects from these factors, further highlights the species- and context-specific nature of dawn chorus drivers. Temperature, for instance, has been shown to influence singing behaviour (Bruni et al. 2014; Hasan 2011; Hasan & Badri 2016; Puswal et al. 2021; Paterno et al. 2024), and moon illumination has been linked to dawn song performance (York et al. 2014; Nakamura-Garcia & Ríos-Chelén 2022; Paterno et al.2024). The observed patterns for these abiotic factors are not universally consistent across all avian species and environments described in the existing literature (Swaddle et al. 2015; Halfwerk & Jerem 2021; Marin-Gomez & Macgregor-Fors 2021).</p>

                                <p>Biodiversity hotspots are defined by two strict criteria: they must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemics (i.e., they are found nowhere else on Earth), and they must have lost at least 70 percent of their primary native vegetation. Identifying and protecting these areas is a cornerstone of global conservation strategies, as they represent irreplaceable ecosystems facing immense threat. Focusing conservation resources on these hotspots can yield significant returns in terms of preserving the planet's unique flora and fauna.</p>

                                <p>The avian dawn chorus, a prominent burst of vocal activity around the onset of natural light, represents a fundamental aspect of avian behavioural ecology during the breeding season[cite: 4]. [cite_start]This complex phenomenon serves crucial functions, including mate attraction, territorial defence, and mate guarding[cite: 5]. [cite_start]The precise timing of the dawn chorus is primarily influenced by natural light intensity [cite: 6][cite_start], which is thought to provide optimal acoustic transmission conditions due to reduced atmospheric turbulence and lower background noise[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Beyond light, a suite of other natural variables, such as ambient temperature, humidity, and moon illumination, are also known to shape the onset and patterns of dawn singing[cite: 8, 9].</p>
                                <p>For instance, colder temperatures can lead to a delay in the onset of dawn song or impact song output [cite: 10, 11][cite_start], while brighter moonlight has been linked to earlier singing[cite: 11, 12].</p>
                                <p>However, the increasing expansion of human settlements has introduced pervasive environmental stressors, notably anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN)[cite: 13, 14]. [cite_start]A substantial body of research, predominantly from temperate regions, indicates that birds commonly advance the onset of their dawn chorus in response to elevated levels of both anthropogenic noise and ALAN[cite: 15, 16]. [cite_start]This temporal adjustment is widely considered an adaptive strategy [cite: 17][cite_start], allowing birds to vocalise during quieter periods before the masking effects of human-generated sounds, such as traffic noise, become too intense[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Similarly, ALAN is frequently observed to induce earlier dawn chorus initiation [cite: 18, 19][cite_start], likely by simulating an earlier sunrise or directly impacting circadian rhythms[cite: 19]. [cite_start]While the relative importance of noise versus light as drivers of these shifts remains a subject of ongoing debate [cite: 20, 21][cite_start], the general pattern of advancement of dawn chorus onset in urban birds is well-established[cite: 21].</p>
                                <p>Despite the growing volume of scientific inquiry, our understanding of avian responses to these anthropogenic pressures remains largely concentrated on temperate ecosystems[cite: 22]. [cite_start]Tropical environments, characterised by less pronounced seasonal variations in day length [cite: 23][cite_start], may elicit distinct avian behavioural responses to urban disturbances[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Indeed, some studies conducted in tropical contexts have presented less consistent patterns, or even contrary findings, where anthropogenic noise is associated with a delay in activity or song onset[cite: 24]. [cite_start]Notably, a study conducted near tropical airports in Brazil revealed that four out of 15 tropical bird species exhibited a significant delay in their dawn song onset in noisier sites compared to quiet controls[cite: 25]. [cite_start]For example, species like the Southern Beardless-Tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum) and the Southern House Wren (Troglodytes musculus) were among those showing such delays, with reported delays of approximately 12.3 minutes and 16 minutes respectively in noisier conditions[cite: 26]. [cite_start]This observation of a significant delay was highlighted as a novel and surprising finding at the time[cite: 27]. [cite_start]Proposed explanations for these delays include limitations imposed by earlier airport activity, the relatively constant day length in tropical regions limiting the birds' temporal plasticity, or potentially reduced competition for acoustic space in noise-affected areas[cite: 28]. [cite_start]Other studies in tropical cities, for instance, on Rufous-collared Sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis), found noise, but not ALAN, predicted earlier song onset [cite: 29][cite_start], while for Saffron Finches (Sicalis flaveola), ALAN rather than noise drove earlier singing[cite: 29]. [cite_start]Such varied responses underscore the complex interplay of factors in tropical environment[cite: 30].</p>
                                <p>In this paper, we aimed to further investigate the influence of anthropogenic noise and other environmental factors on the timing of the dawn chorus in a tropical bird species, the Common Tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius)[cite: 31]. [cite_start]We assessed the effects of anthropogenic noise, artificial light, temperature, humidity, and moon illumination on the dawn chorus onset using a linear regression model[cite: 32]. [cite_start]Contrary to the widespread findings of dawn chorus advancement in response to noise, our model suggests that the onset of the dawn chorus in Common Tailorbirds delays with increasing anthropogenic noise levels[cite: 33]. [cite_start]Furthermore, our analysis revealed no significant effect of artificial light, temperature, humidity, or moon illumination on the timing of the dawn chorus in this species[cite: 34]. [cite_start]This unique finding of a noise-induced delay in a tropical bird contributes to a more nuanced understanding of avian behavioural plasticity in response to an increasingly human-modified environment, highlighting the need for geographically diverse research to capture the full spectrum of avian adaptive strategies[cite: 35].</p>
