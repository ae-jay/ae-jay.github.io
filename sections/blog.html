                             <p>The absence of a significant effect of artificial light at night (ALAN) on the common tailorbird's dawn chorus onset, while contrasting with many temperate studies that show advancements (Kempenaers et al. 2010; Da Silva et al. 2015; Nordt & Klenke 2013), aligns with several other previous investigations in tropical regions that also found no such association (Dorado-Correa et al. 2016; Stuart et al. 2019). This supports the hypothesis that tropical species, experiencing minimal seasonal photoperiodic variation, may be less sensitive to light as a critical cue for timing reproductive behaviours such as dawn song (Dorado-Correa et al. 2016). Similarly, the lack of significant influence from temperature, humidity, and moon illumination on dawn chorus timing, despite some studies reporting effects from these factors, further highlights the species- and context-specific nature of dawn chorus drivers. Temperature, for instance, has been shown to influence singing behaviour (Bruni et al. 2014; Hasan 2011; Hasan & Badri 2016; Puswal et al. 2021; Paterno et al. 2024), and moon illumination has been linked to dawn song performance (York et al. 2014; Nakamura-Garcia & Ríos-Chelén 2022; Paterno et al. 2024). The observed patterns for these abiotic factors are not universally consistent across all avian species and environments described in the existing literature (Swaddle et al. 2015; Halfwerk & Jerem 2021; Marin-Gomez & Macgregor-Fors 2021).</p>
